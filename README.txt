VideoSort post-processing script for NZBGet.

This is a script for downloaded TV shows and movies. It uses scene-standard naming conventions to match TV shows and movies and rename/move/sort/organize them as you like.

The script relies on python library "guessit" (http://guessit.readthedocs.org) to extract information from file names and includes portions of code from "SABnzbd+" (http://sabnzbd.org).
